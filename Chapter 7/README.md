# Chapter 7: Color Detection

In this chapter, we will explore how to detect specific colors in images using OpenCV. Color detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, often used in applications like object tracking, image segmentation, and more.

### ðŸŽ¨ Color Detection

**Color Detection** involves identifying and isolating specific colors within an image. By filtering out other colors, you can focus on particular objects or regions of interest.

#### Key Points:
- **Color Spaces**: Convert images from BGR to other color spaces like HSV, which is often more effective for color detection.
- **Thresholding**: Define a range of color values to create masks that isolate the desired color.
- **Application**: Commonly used in object tracking, image segmentation, detecting traffic lights, or identifying colored objects in a scene.
