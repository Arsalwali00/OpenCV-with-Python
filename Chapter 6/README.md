# Chapter 6: Stacking Images

In this chapter, we will learn how to stack images together using OpenCV. This technique is useful for creating side-by-side comparisons, assembling images into grids, or displaying multiple images in a single window.

**Stacking Images** involves combining multiple images into a single image, either horizontally, vertically, or in a grid. This is particularly helpful when you want to compare different images or display them together in a cohesive way.

#### Key Points:
- **Horizontal and Vertical Stacking**: You can stack images either side by side (horizontal stacking) or one on top of the other (vertical stacking).
- **Image Size Compatibility**: All images being stacked should ideally have the same size. If not, you may need to resize them to ensure uniformity.
- **Grid Layouts**: By stacking images both horizontally and vertically, you can create grid layouts that display multiple images in a structured format.
- **Application**: Commonly used in tasks like visual comparisons, image galleries, and creating composite images for reports or presentations.
